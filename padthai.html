          <h3>Description:</h3>
          <p>Pad thai, phat thai, or phad thai,
             is a stir-fried rice noodle dish commonly
              served as a street food in Thailand as part 
              of the country's cuisine. It is typically
               made with rice noodles, shrimp, peanuts, 
               a scrambled egg, and bean sprouts, among 
               other vegetables. The ingredients are fried
                in a wok. </p>
                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Rice noodles</li>
                  <li>Protein</li>
                  <li>Veggies</li>
                  <li>Garlic</li>
                  <li>Eggs</li>
                  <li>Toppings</li>
                  <li>Tamarind concentrate</li>
                  <li>Brown sugar</li>
                  <li>Fish sauce</li>
                  <li>Soy sauce</li>
                  <li>Lime Juice</li>
                  <li>Crushed red pepper flakes</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Directions:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make the sauce. First things 
                        first — go ahead and prep the
                         sauce by whisking all of the
                          ingredients together 
                          (or shaking them in a jar)
                           until combined.</li>
                    <li>Cook the noodles. Next, go ahead
                         and heat your water and cook the
                          noodles al dente according to 
                          the package instructions, then
                           drain the excess water. If your
                            noodles finish earlier than 
                            your stir-fry, I recommend 
                            rinsing them briefly with some 
                            lukewarm water and tossing them
                             with a drizzle of oil to 
                             prevent them from sticking
                              while they wait.</li>
                    <li>Cook the protein, veggies and 
                        eggs. Meanwhile, go ahead and 
                        begin your stir-fry. First, sauté
                        your protein of choice until cooked
                         through, then transfer it to a
                          clean plate and set it aside. 
                          Next, sauté the veggies until
                           crisp-tender. Then push them 
                           to one side of the pan and 
                           briefly scramble the eggs in 
                           the other half of the pan until
                            cooked.</li>
                    <li>Put it all together. Then add 
                        everything back in with the eggs
                         and veggies — the cooked noodles,
                          cooked chicken, sauce and green 
                          onions — and give the mixture a
                           good toss until everything is 
                           evenly coated in the sauce.</li>
                    <li>Serve. Then serve the noodles
                         immediately while they are nice 
                         and hot, garnished with lots of 
                         toppings and fresh lime wedges 
                         for squeezing.</li>
                </ul>
