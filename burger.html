          <h3>Description:</h3>
          <p>A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food 
            consisting of fillings—usually a patty of 
            ground meat, typically beef—placed inside 
            a sliced bun or bread roll.</p>
                <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound ground lean (7% fat) beef </li>
                    <li>1 large egg </li>
                    <li>½ cup minced onion </li>
                    <li>¼ cup fine dried bread crumbs</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire </li>
                    <li>1 or 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced </li>
                    <li>About 1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
                    <li>About 1/4 teaspoon pepper </li>
                    <li>4 hamburger buns (4 in. wide), split</li>
                    <li>About 1/4 cup mayonnaise </li>
                    <li>About 1/4 cup ketchup </li>
                    <li>4 iceberg lettuce leaves, rinsed and crisped </li>
                    <li>1 firm-ripe tomato, cored and thinly sliced </li>
                    <li>4 thin slices red onion </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Directions:</h3>
                <ul>
                 <li>In a bowl, mix ground beef, egg,
                     onion, bread crumbs, Worcestershire,
                      garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 
                      and 1/4 teaspoon pepper until well 
                      blended. Divide mixture into four 
                      equal portions and shape each into 
                      a patty about 4 inches wide.</li>
                 <li>Lay burgers on an oiled barbecue
                     grill over a solid bed of hot coals
                      or high heat on a gas grill 
                      (you can hold your hand at grill 
                      level only 2 to 3 seconds); close 
                      lid on gas grill. Cook burgers, 
                      turning once, until browned on both 
                      sides and no longer pink inside (cut
                       to test), 7 to 8 minutes total.
                        Remove from grill.</li>
                 <li>Lay buns, cut side down, on grill and
                     cook until lightly toasted, 30 seconds
                      to 1 minute.</li>
                 <li>Spread mayonnaise and ketchup on bun 
                    bottoms. Add lettuce, tomato, burger,
                     onion, and salt and pepper to taste. 
                     Set bun tops in place.</li>
                </ul>
